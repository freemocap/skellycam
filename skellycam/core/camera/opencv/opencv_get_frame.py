    THIS IS WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS

    This method is responsible for grabbing the next frame from the camera - it is the point of "transduction"
     when a pattern of environmental energy (i.e. a timeslice of the 2D pattern of light intensity in 3 wavelengths
      within the field of view of the camera ) is absorbed by the camera's sensor and converted into a digital
      representation of that pattern (i.e. a 2D array of pixel values in 3 channels).

    This is the empirical measurement, whereupon all future inference will derive their epistemological grounding.

    This sweet baby must be protected at all costs.

    We use external frame_loop_flags and decouple frame `grab` and `retrieve` operations to ensure that we can
    get as tight of a synchronization as possible between the cameras
